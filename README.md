# LED
LED Scripts made using Python. This will hopefully be an ongoing project to apply graphics and cool visualizations to a grid of LEDs (WS2812B) using python. Currently, I'm using a Raspberry Pi 3, but I might swtich to an Arduino since it saves a lot of the extra power supply issues and should cut down on the bulk of the actual hardware. The end goal would be a a totem or similar visualizer to bring to concerts and festivals!
